⟵ Me

I'm Bernardo, a Systems Software Engineer at [Standard Cognition][stcg] where I
work writing high-performance Rust.

I was born in Brazil, and studied Computer Engineering at [IST][ist] in Lisbon,
Portugal before dropping out. I now live in San Francisco, California, and you
can reach me at [bernardo@meurer.org][persmail].
