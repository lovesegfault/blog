I'm Bernardo, a software engineer at AWS, where I work on Rust build systems.

Previously, I worked at Google Quantum AI on the QKernel, the control stack for
the quantum computer, and QCC, the quantum circuit compiler.

I was born in Brazil, and studied Computer Engineering at [IST][ist] in Lisbon,
Portugal before dropping out. I now live in New York City, and you can reach me
at [bernardo@meurer.org][persmail].

You can read more about me in my [CV][cv].
